The [yearly competitive coding puzzle event](https://adventofcode.com/) in the form of an advent calendar starts very soon: 25 days of programming challenges. Each day from the 1st to the 25th of December, a new 2-part puzzle is released. Completion of a part awards one a star. Last year I got 11 out of 50.

I'll paste my personal leaderboard (for the 2023 set) here:

```
      --------Part 1---------   --------Part 2---------
Day       Time    Rank  Score       Time    Rank  Score
  6       >24h   94062      0       >24h   92558      0
  5       >24h   92827      0          -       -      -

```

The competitive aspect is in trying to be one of the first to solve a puzzle - the first 100 get points. I wasn't going for speed last year, nor am I focusing on speed this year.

I'm giving it a go, at my own pace.

I've prepared a repo for it:

My plan for this year:

- Do as many as I can, in JavaScript
- write about the process

Some programmers use this an opportunity to test out a new language. Other have made [competition-oriented languages](https://healeycodes.com/designing-a-programming-language-for-advent-of-code) to give them an edge at tackling these puzzles quickly.

I'm just using plain good old JS.

I've prepared a function to load text files into memory. I'll add other util functions as I go along.

More AoC updates to come.
