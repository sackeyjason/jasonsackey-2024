I wrote about my impressions with this software development platform:

https://medium.com/@jason.sackey/cors-and-request-parsing-in-begin-com-functions-4b5cee3139d6

I expressed some confusion about certain obstacles and described some workarounds. Ryan from the project replied on Twitter and helped me towards figuring out the issues, and I'm quite satisfied with proper solutions.

I amended my post with the answers. But I think it'd be useful to have a post with only the specific 'right' answers, without the less-than-optimal workaround hacks there to confuse people. So, TODO.

One other mystery comes to mind, I'm not sure if the platform would support 'unlimited', 'open' url paths, e.g.

wiki.example.com/welcome-visitors/hypertext/web/blog/social-media/facebook/twitter/miasma

Where each of those terms between '/'s are pages, to be displayed lined up, Fedwiki-style.

An investigation, TODO. Along with Authentication.
