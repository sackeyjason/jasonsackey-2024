Abbreviation: hypertext markup language

A file format for text documents. As you use the web, your browser downloads content in this format, interprets it, and presents you with a web page.

- [What's **hypertext**?](https://jasonsackey.com/2019/02/18/on-hypertext-its-origins-as-it-is-and-as-it-could-be/) Basically, text with links to other text.
- As can be seen by opening it in a text editor, the HTML of a page generally contains its readable text content. Additionally, it contains **markup**. This is extra information about the content's structure, meaning, and functionality.
- It's a computer **language**. There are specific rules that define valid HTML. It can be written and read by human beings. In practice, it's mostly computer-generated -- human authors write things with tools like WordPress which, operated properly, create the appropriate additional markup on our behalf.

## Examples

<h1>Definition list</h1>
